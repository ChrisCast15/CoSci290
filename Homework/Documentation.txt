Plot: You are a new employee of the 
Interplanetary Corporation – a conglomerate 
that has a monopoly on Mars. You are there
for a job in the mining sector as the company 
has found uses for the iron deposits on Mars. 
On your first day a tunneler’s sensors fail 
and proceeds to dig to the center of the planet, 
causes a massive earthquake and the local wildlife, 
now contaminated with mining chemicals, goes berserk 
and break into the Corporation complex. You now must 
find an escape pod, but as you reach the first couple 
of pods in the game, you find out that some of them 
do not function due to the Corporation cutting corners.
